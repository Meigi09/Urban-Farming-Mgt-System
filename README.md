# Urban Farming Management System

## Problem Statement:
With the growing urban population, sustainable farming practices are needed to provide fresh produce within cities. Urban farms face challenges in tracking crop cycles, managing space, monitoring resources, and ensuring consistent production. A database solution would enable urban farms to operate efficiently, improve productivity, and optimize resource use.

## Objectives:
- Build a system to manage crops, schedules, and yield records.
- Track resources like water, soil quality, and fertilizers.
- Manage multiple farm plots and optimize space usage.
- Generate reports on productivity and resource utilization.

## Main Entities:
- Farm Plots: ID, size, location, crop type.
- Crops: Name, type, growth stage, yield per cycle.
- Resources: Water, soil quality, fertilizers.
- Farmers: ID, name, contact, assigned plot.
- Harvests: Date, crop, quantity, plot location.

## Expected Outcomes:
- Enhanced productivity through better management of resources.
- Optimized space and time for crop rotations and harvesting.
- Reduced resource wastage and increased crop yield

## Handling Data Scenarios
This logical model addresses the initial challenges:
- Scalability: The model can add more farms, crops, and clients without structural changes.
- Centralization: Unified database for crop management, sustainability tracking, and client coordination.
- Sustainability: Metrics link directly to crops and farms, allowing for targeted monitoring
